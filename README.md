# fireexit
Repo for the csi18n "Fire Exit" example page

Live page: http://www.pectw.net/csi18n/fireexit/

Documentation: http://csi18n.mpsvr.com/index.php/Fireexit

This project made use of the separate csi18n backend, which is currently turned off.

csi18n comes from *Crowd-Sourced Internationalisation* and is a 2014 project designed around allowing people to upload
translations of existing material, voting on the best translation if multiple versions exist, and using HTTPs 
`Accept-Language` and `Content-Language` among others to negotiate who gets to see what.

"Fire Exit" was the first example page, the others being "Dredd" for iOS/Safari implementaton and "XKCD" for process 
analysis (both also on github).
